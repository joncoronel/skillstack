/**
 * The home page's discovery surface — ONE stable layout (no view transitions,
 * no hero-collapse, no relocating search box). The hero, the search composer,
 * and its chin hold fixed positions; only the list region below changes.
 * Typing and activating a filter are therefore the same gesture — both just
 * swap what's in the list — which is what makes the two feel consistent (an
 * earlier design morphed the whole page when you searched, which was jarring
 * when your first action was a filter, not typing).
 *
 * - **Idle:** the SSR'd + infinite-scroll Popular catalog renders.
 * - **Query / filter / non-default sort active:** the list swaps to
 *   Typesense-backed results in the same spot. The Popular list stays mounted
 *   (hidden via <Activity>) so clearing the search restores scroll depth.
 * - **Repo mode:** the same region shows repo match results.
 *
 * URL state comes from the explorer context (provided above, or statically by
 * the Suspense fallback). Search status — the input spinner, the
 * Popular→results handoff, facet counts — is DERIVED here from the shared
 * React Query cache (useCatalogSearchStatus): this component owns the
 * debounced effective query, ActiveCatalogResults fetches under the same key,
 * and nothing is reported back up through effects. Anything that reads
 * Date.now() during render (the Typesense infinite query) still mounts only
 * when a search is active — never in the prerendered idle state.
