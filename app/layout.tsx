// metadataBase makes every relative OG/Twitter image URL absolute (required by
// crawlers). The origin itself lives in lib/site-url.ts, shared with the
// robots and sitemap routes — those emit text and XML, so nothing resolves
// relative URLs for them and they need the same value spelled out.

// Vendored, not fetched: Open Runde isn't on Google Fonts at all, and even if
// it were it has no entry in Next's metrics table, so `next/font/google`
// couldn't build a size-adjusted fallback. `next/font/local` measures the file.
//
// THREE FILES, NOT ONE. Open Runde ships static instances and no variable font,
// which is the whole shape of this config: each weight is a separate ~43 KB
// download and `next/font` preloads every one of them on every route. That is
// why 700 is absent — it had two call sites, both moved to `font-semibold`.
// Adding a weight here is a real cost, and using one that isn't here fails
// quietly: CSS matches the nearest available face rather than synthesising, so
// a `font-bold` would render at 600 and look almost right.
//
// The files are cut from the upstream release by `scripts/build-open-runde.py`,
// which also synthesises the `tnum` the family lacks — read its header before
// regenerating them. No italic, so emphasis is synthesised, as it always was.
// OFL 1.1 requires the licence to travel with them: `app/fonts/OFL-open-runde.txt`.

  // default is what keeps Next generating the metric-matched fallback that
  // holds the layout still. DESIGN.md §3 has the measurements and rules out
  // both a `size-adjust` and ranking a `local("Inter")` ahead of that fallback
  // — read it before adding either back.

// The app's mono face. Both options below are load-bearing. Don't add
// `display: "swap"`: it is the documented default and the @font-face carries it
// either way.
//
// `adjustFontFallback: false` — Google Sans Code has no row in Next's metrics
// table (`next/dist/server/capsize-font-metrics.json`), so the default `true`
// can only fail its lookup and log "Failed to find font override values" on
// every build and dev request. It yields no size-adjusted fallback either way.
//
// `fallback` — without it the loader emits a bare family name, so a failed load
// drops to the browser default, which is proportional. Measured at 20px: `iiiii`
// 27.8px vs `MMMMM` 88.9px bare, both 55.0px with the stack. That is every
// install command, file path and diff marker losing its columns.
