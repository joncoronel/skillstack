// The page is static. <SkillExplorer> reads search params via nuqs' Next
// adapter, which suspends during prerendering — the Suspense fallback below
// renders the identical default no-params state (hero + search shell + popular
// leaderboard) under ExplorerStaticProvider (defaults derived from the URL
// parsers), so the prerendered HTML is the full page and the route stays
// prefetchable. After hydration the live tree applies
// any actual URL params — and stays in sync with Next's client-side router, so
// a <Link> into `/?q=…` (or `/compare?skills=…`) updates the params reactively.
// The popular leaderboard is cached with `'use cache'` and tagged via
// `cacheTag`; the Convex sync cron revalidates that tag (see
// app/api/revalidate/route.ts), so the snapshot stays fresh without a
// per-request Convex hit. The `cacheLife` window is a safety net for a missed
// cron ping.
//
// Hot and Trending are NOT fetched here. They render only inside the
// leaderboard sheet, which starts closed, so prefetching them put 90 skill
// rows into every visitor's payload for a surface most never open. The sheet
// fetches the tab it is showing; see `useLeaderboard` in
// components/leaderboard-sheet.tsx.
