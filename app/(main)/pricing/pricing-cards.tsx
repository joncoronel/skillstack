/**
 * DIRECTION CONTRACT — pricing cards
 *
 * THESIS: Free is the whole product at personal scale; Pro is the same product
 * without the ceiling. So: two cards, and Pro's list is "Everything in Free,
 * plus" three lines. Refuses the comparison plate this page shipped, whose
 * nine rows were mostly two identical ticks and got skipped by every reader.
 *
 * OWN-WORLD: The committed Control Panel system. Violet-tinted neutrals, the
 * surface ladder for lift, one blue signal on the one action that matters
 * (Pro's button). No new tokens, no second face, no decoration.
 *
 * STORY: The reader sees Free covers a personal setup, sees exactly three
 * things Pro adds, and knows within seconds which card is theirs.
 *
 * FIRST VIEWPORT: Hero stating the offer in one line, the billing toggle, then
 * both cards with prices and actions visible. Nothing below the fold is needed
 * to decide.
 *
 * FORM: Two cards, shaped directly from a precise brief (no direction roll:
 * the user specified the form). Motion is spent twice: the toggle's sliding
 * indicator and the Pro price crossfading between cycles.
 *
 * FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the
 * finish review, the verdict, and DESIGN.md.
